# Zoom Meeting Audio And Video Capture

This is a Python script that can be used to join a Zoom meeting and capture the audio and video streams. It uses the PyAutoGUI, PyAudio, and OpenCV libraries to automate the process of joining the meeting and capturing the audio and video.

## Prerequisites
Before running this script, you'll need to make sure you have the following libraries installed:
* PyAutoGUI
* PyAudio
* OpenCV

You'll also need to have the Zoom desktop application installed on your computer.

## Usage
To use this script, simply run the main.py file and follow the prompts to enter the meeting ID and password. The script will then join the meeting and start capturing the audio and video streams.

The captured audio and video will be saved to files named audio.wav and video.mp4, respectively.

To stop the script, press the 'q' key while the video window is in focus.
